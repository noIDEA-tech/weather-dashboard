## Description
This is a weather dashboard application that users may use to pull up a 5-day weather forecast by entering a city name in the input field and clicking on the "search" button. This prompt will call the OpenWeather API and produce a current day weather forecast in the top box with a 5-day forecast directly below it. Previous city searches will be saved for the user to manage by retrieving a previous search or clearing the search history by clicking on the delete icon located next to each city saved in the search history.
